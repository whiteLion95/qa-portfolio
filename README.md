# QA Portfolio â€“ Major Mayhem Clone

This repository contains QA documentation and test artifacts for a Unity-based mobile game project created by me.  
The game is a simplified clone of this game - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rocketjump.majormayhem2  
- The character auto-runs from left to right.  
- At checkpoints, the character hides behind crates while enemies spawn.  
- Player taps the screen to shoot enemies.  
- Headshots instantly kill enemies with a death animation and "Headshot" popup text.  
- The player loses HP when hit by enemy bullets.  
- The game ends with a victory animation and a "Play Again" button after the last checkpoint.
